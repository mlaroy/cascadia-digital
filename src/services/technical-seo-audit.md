<p class="mb-4">Let’s face it - you work hard on your website, but you’re not seeing the kinds of results you’re looking for. So what’s missing? The problem is, you might not know what you don’t know.</p>
<p class="mb-8">When it comes to search engine optimization, there are a lot more factors that contribute to your success than simply using the right collection of key words in your copy. What else is there?</p>

<h2 class="mb-4">What a technical SEO audit can reveal</h2>


<p class="mb-4">Digging in deeper, a technical audit can uncover many things you might not yet have considered. Some of these things might include: </p>

<ul class="mb-4 list-inside list-disc pl-8">
  <li>How does your site look on small or mobile devices?</li>
  <li>Does your website take a long time to load?</li>
  <li>Are you using the proper HTML tags for your content?</li>
  <li>What are you primary sources of traffic?</li>
  <li>How many other websites link back to yours?</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">These are all factors that search engines take into account when evaluating how high your website should rank for a particular set of search terms.</p>

<p class="mb-8">For example, Google began factoring page speed into its search algorithm back in 2010, and did the same for being mobile frienly in 2018. These aren’t new factors, but many websites still don’t account for them, hurting their search rankings.</p>

<h2>What you will get</h2>

<p class="mb-4">With my <span>Technical SEO Audit</span>, you will get a broad analysis of these factors (and more) that can affect your SEO ranking, over and above the quality of your actual content.</p>
<p class="mb-12">You will receive a report indentifying these issues, along with recommendations on how to go about fixing them.</p>
